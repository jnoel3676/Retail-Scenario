Running the Server
------------------

To run the Node.js server, you will need to navigate into the aimbuddy-api directory.

Once there, run `npm start` and make sure it outputs:

```
app is running on port 3000
```

Running the Client
------------------
To run the ReactJS client, you will need to navigate into the aimbuddy-react directory.

Once there, run `npm start` and it will ask if you would like to switch to a different port.

Type `y` and hit enter.

The client will now start.
